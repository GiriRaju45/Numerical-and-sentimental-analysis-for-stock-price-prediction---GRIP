## In this repository, I've implemented the task of Stock Price Prediction which I've completed for my internship at The Sparks Foundation.

The main objective of the task is to perform the numerical and sentimental analysis of the stock and built a hybrid model to predict the price of the stock price.

The Numerical Analysis is on the share price data.

Using the resulting dataframe values, I've provided them into LSTM and performed the price prediction of the stock.
